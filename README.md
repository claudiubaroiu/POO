            Supermarket Management System
        Project Overview
    This project implements a Supermarket Management System, an application designed to manage a supermarket's operations effectively. The application handles the management of multiple stores, the products sold within them, and the employees working there. It is built using C++ and employs object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to ensure modularity and reusability.

        Motivation
    The primary motivation for selecting this topic is the opportunity to deepen my understanding of C++ programming while applying OOP concepts. I also wanted to compare and contrast the implementation of similar projects across different programming languages, building upon knowledge gained from previous coursework. This project allowed me to enhance my problem-solving skills and explore file handling in C++.

        Problem Description
    The application manages:

1.Stores: Information such as name, location, and operating hours.
2.Products: Details like product name, price, and category (e.g., fruits, vegetables).
3.Employees: Employee details such as name, age, and ID.
    Operations supported include adding, removing, and searching for products or employees.
        Theoretical Approach
    Key elements of the solution include:

1. File Handling:
    The application reads and writes data to files for persistent storage using ifstream and ofstream. Data, such as product details, is stored in text files and parsed as needed. For instance:
ifstream file("filename.txt");
ofstream file("filename.txt");

2.Object-Oriented Programming:
    The solution uses OOP concepts like:
    Classes and Objects: To represent entities like Product, Employee, and Supermarket.
    Encapsulation: Separating the interface and implementation of classes.
    Abstraction: Representing real-world entities with essential attributes and operations.
    Polymorphism and Inheritance: Facilitating code reuse and flexibility.

        Technologies Used
    Programming Language:
1.C++: Selected for its performance and extensive library support.
    Development Environment:
1.Code::Blocks IDE: Chosen for its user-friendly interface and cross-platform support.
2.Linux: The project was developed in a Linux environment using VirtualBox for virtualization.
    Libraries:
1.fstream: For file input/output operations.
2.iostream: For user interaction via the console.
3.string: For manipulating strings and parsing file data.


            How to Use the Project
        Clone the Repository:

bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd supermarket-management
    Compile the Code: Use Code::Blocks or a terminal to compile the project.

    Run the Application: Execute the binary file to interact with the system and manage supermarket data.
